     " * Normalize\n"
     "\n"
     "   This amplifies the sound as much as possible without getting clipping distortion. \n"
     "\n"
     " * Volume adjust/fade...\n"
     "\n"
     "   This effect lets you select a starting volume and a ending volume and amplifies the selection fading from the starting volume to the ending volume.\n"
     "\n"
     "   Note that volumes above 100% may cause sound distortion. Use the 'Find top volume' to find out the maximum amplification possible without distortion. (You can use this for normalizing samples.) \n"
     "\n"
     "   By setting starting volume and ending volume to the same value you get a simple amplification of the sound. \n"
     "\n"
     " * Convert samplerate...\n"
     "\n"
     "   This converts the samplerate of the entire file to one you specify. There are different methods for doing this, usually the one in the top has the best quality but can take longer than the other methode.\n"
     "\n"
     " * Convert sample format...\n"
     "\n"
     "   This converts the sample format of the entire file.\n"
     "\n"
     "   The 'Don't actually change the data' option can be used if the program was wrong about the file's format.\n"
     "\n"
     " * Byte swap\n"
     "\n"
     "   This \"byte swaps\" the selected part. It can be used to repair damaged files where the byte order is wrong. Note that if the sound looks alright but plays wrong, you should not use this option, instead you should use the \"byte-swap output\" option in the Preferences dialog.\n"
     "\n"
     " * Mix channels...\n"
     "\n"
     "   This mixes all channels of the file together to a mono sound.\n"

This means you can do channel mixing / swapping / balance / panning / amplification etc. by entering different values. For example, to swap the left and right channel, you select that the new Channel 1 should be 0% of the old Channel 1 and 100% of the old Channel 2, and the new Channel 2 should be 100% of the old Channel 1 and 0% of the old Channel 2 \n"

     "\n"
     "The general rule when doing audio editing/processing is to not manipulate the data more than necessary and keep an original copy whenever you're processing your important files. \n"
     "\n"
     "Cut, copy and paste operations move the data around without modifying it, so these don't degrade the sound quality. Because of level differences, you may get a \"step\" at the start and end of the inserted part, which can cause a small clicking sound. \n"
     "\n"
     "The mix paste function doesn't decrease quality, unless the peaks become too high and you get clipping. In that case you will get a warning message.\n"
     "\n"
     "Sound data is normally stored as integer values. Therefore, whenever you normalize, adjust volume, decrease sample size or filter a sound, the result must be rounded. If you use 24 or 32 bit sample sizes, this is not really a problem, but if you use 8 or 16 bits sample size, this rounding causes a decrease in quality. \n"
     "\n"
     "The quality decrease that the rounding causes can be masked by adding a small amount of noise before rounding. This is called \"dithering\". mhWaveEdit supports basic triangular dithering and it's enabled by default. \n"
